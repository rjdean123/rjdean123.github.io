## Other Relevant Experience
Aside from school and work, I'm usually working on a project of some sort on the side to sharpen my skills and/or make useful things. Examples include:

* A Google cardboard virtual reality game
* A Twitter hashtag tracking tool using Python
* Some simple apps and utilities using iOS, Ruby on Rails, and node.js with Express
