## Other Relevant Experience
Aside from school and work, I'm usually working on a project of some sort on the side to sharpen my skills and/or make useful things. Examples include:
* An Android application that scraped grades off of my high school's grade reporting website for easier mobile digestion
* An Android background service that pauses the music in my headphones when someone in the vicinity addresses me by name
* A Google cardboard virtual reality game
* A Twitter hashtag tracking tool using Python
* Some simple apps and utilities using iOS, Ruby on Rails, and node.js with Express
