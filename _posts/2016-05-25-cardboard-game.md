#### This game is a first-person turret shooter, loosely inspired by Space Invaders. To play:

* To look around, just look around (pretty straightforward)
* To shoot, press the button on the Cardboard (or tap the screen)

* Shoot these guys to earn points
* Alternatively, if they get to you before you kill them, you lose a life

* Shooting a heart gives you an extra life
